This program can be installed on a Raspberry Pi (or any Linux box) to provide an easy Wi-Fi packet capture tool.

Once installed, it is controlled by a web browser on any operating system, so you're not tied to a specific vendor OS.

When installed on a Raspberry Pi with a suitable USB Wi-Fi capturing adapter, the Raspberry Pi's own built in Wi-Fi adapter is just used as a control interface, not to capture.

The Raspberry Pi can be connected to a mobile phone hotspot, and controlled directly with a browser pointing to the IP address of the Raspberry Pi.

To connect to the web UI go to:

http://IPADDRESS:5000

For added flexibility, you could install Wireguard VPN on the Raspberry Pi to connect it back to your network, and then connect to it remotely via Wireguard.

User can install any number of suitable Wi-Fi adapters, and they will be set to monitor mode and made available to capture packets.


**Channel selection:**

<img width="383" height="906" alt="channel selection" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3805e5a-94dd-46a9-a686-18b879eaf7d9" />

The channel selection is broken up into 3 RF Bands: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.

The 2.4 GHz channels are 5 MHz apart, and are displayed with channels 1, 6, and 11 on the left hand column for easy selection of these preferred channels.

The 5 GHz channels are in rows corresponding to their 80 MHz bonded channels.

The 'All' button selects/de-selects all channels in that RF band.

All captures in 5 GHz and 6 GHz are taken at 80 MHz, so regardless of which channel is selected in a 5 GHz row, it will capture the 80 MHz bonded channel for any main channel of that row.

The channel selection is for the 20 MHz main channel.

Example:

If channel 40 is selected, it will capture traffic on channel 40 (20 MHz wide), bonded 36 and 40 (40 MHz wide), and bonded 36, 40, 44, and 48 (80 MHz wide). 



**Dwell time:**

This sets how long to stay on each channel. Default is 200 ms.

**Packet types:**

This lets you select various capture filters to avoid capture file being unnecessarily large.

There are three types of frames in Wi-Fi: Management, Control, and Data. By default all frames will be captured.

Within each frame type are subtypes. If only some subtypes are wanted, they can be selected here. Note that if you select all of the subtypes available individually, it's not the same as selecting all frames of that type at the top, as not all subtypes are listed. Selecting all at the top will capture all of that type.

**Filename prefix:**

This adds a convenient name to the packet capture file, which gets appended to the time.

Example:

2025-12-21--13-25-13-walkingaroundshops.pcap

If no name is given, it will default to the adapter name.



**File split:**

This breaks the packet captures into multiple files, after set time. Default is none for one continuous file.

**Multi-adapter capture:**

If the system has two or more Wi-Fi capture devices, each device can be set to a different channel, and then selected here to enable capturing multiple adapters into a single capture file.

Filename prefix and file split are the same as above for single adapters.



**Download last capture:**

This button downloads the most recent capture directly from the web interface.

If capture is currently running, it will download what has been captured so far without interfering with the current packet capture.



**Shut down system:**

If you need an explanation for this, then this software isn't for you.


All packet captures are saved in the home directory.
